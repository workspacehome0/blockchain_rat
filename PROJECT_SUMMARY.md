# Blockchain RAT - Project Summary

## 🎯 Project Overview

A fully functional **blockchain-based Remote Administration Tool (RAT)** built entirely in **Python**, using the **Polygon blockchain** for command and control communication. This eliminates the need for traditional TCP/HTTP connections, making it highly resistant to network-based detection and blocking.

   - Session management (create, select, monitor)
   - Command interface with quick commands and custom JSON
   - Real-time response display
   - Blockchain connection management
   - Balance and gas price monitoring

3. **Agent (Python)**
   - Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS)
   - Command execution engine
   - Blockchain polling for new commands
   - Automatic response encryption and transmission
   - System information gathering
   - Screenshot capture
   - File operations

4. **Shared Libraries (Python)**
   - **encryption.py**: Hybrid RSA+AES-256-GCM encryption
   - **blockchain_client.py**: Web3.py-based blockchain interaction
   - Automatic compression and encoding
   - Public key management

## 🔐 Security Features

### Encryption

- **Hybrid Encryption**: RSA-2048 for key exchange, AES-256-GCM for data
- **Compression**: Automatic gzip compression before encryption
- **Encoding**: Base64 + JSON for blockchain compatibility
- **Key Management**: Separate keypairs for admin and each agent
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: Session keys are ephemeral

### Blockchain Security

- **Sequence Numbers**: Prevents replay attacks
- **Session Isolation**: Each session has unique ID and keys
- **Access Control**: Smart contract enforces admin/agent roles
- **Immutable Audit Trail**: All commands recorded on blockchain

## 💰 Cost Analysis

### Polygon Network Costs (Testnet & Mainnet)

| Operation | Gas Used | Cost (MATIC) | Cost (USD) |
|-----------|----------|--------------|------------|
| Agent Registration | ~50,000 | 0.001 | $0.0001 |
| Session Creation | ~100,000 | 0.002 | $0.0002 |
| Send Command (small) | ~60,000 | 0.0012 | $0.00012 |
| Send Command (large) | ~150,000 | 0.003 | $0.0003 |

## 🎓 How It Works

### Session Flow

1. **Setup Phase**
   ```
   Admin deploys contract → Agent registers with public key
   → Admin creates session → Agent starts polling
   ```

2. **Command Phase**
   ```
   Admin encrypts command → Sends to blockchain → Agent polls
   → Agent decrypts → Executes → Encrypts response → Sends to blockchain
   → Admin polls → Decrypts → Displays in GUI
   ```

3. **Communication**
   ```
   All data flows through blockchain transactions
   No direct network connection between admin and agent
   End-to-end encryption ensures privacy
   ```

## 🌟 Key Innovations

1. **Zero Direct Connections**: No TCP/IP between admin and agent
2. **Blockchain as Transport**: Uses Polygon for all communication
3. **Cost Optimization**: Compression + efficient encoding
4. **Python-First**: Entire stack in Python for simplicity
5. **Production Ready**: Complete with GUI, tests, and docs
